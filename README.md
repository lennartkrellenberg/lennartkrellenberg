### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Since 2015 I am interested in programming.
It all started when I had my own Minecraft server with friends and we wanted to program our own Minecraft plugins and game modes. This didn't let me go - so I got more and more involved with software development. At Udemy I found a course where you could learn how to develop Android apps. I became interested in the topic so much that I did my internship in 9th grade at the software agency Bornholdt Lee. There I programmed my first own Android app.
Since nearly 1,5 years I am working with Flutter to develop apps for Android and Ios.
Along the way I've also been working with Gatsby to create websites for friends, school or just for fun.
